FTC Robotics Codebase, 2025-2026 Game

This is a programming repo for a iteration of the FTC robotics 2025-2026 game.

Stage 1 denotes files before 04/12/26,
Stage 2 denotes files before 14/04/26,
Stage 3 denotes files between 15/04/26 and end of season.

Files are divided into two classes:
    - Dummy Plug: Denotes Autonomous
        marked as dmX_V.java
        where X is 01, or 02, dictating left side auto or right side auto
        where V is the stage (V = 2 is a stage 2 iteration)
        Ex: dm01_2.java (Left side auto, stage 2)
    - Numbering system starts: Denotes Teleoperations
        marked as xx_V.java
        where xx can either be 01, or 13
        01: Single Controller Program
        13: Double Controller Program
        where V is the stage_
        Ex: 01_3.java is Single Controller Stage 3 Teleop Program
    - Interim:
        xx_VA.java, or dmX_VA.java
        'A' means that this program is a interim version that needs more work or is still under development.
        Ex: 13_3A.java (Double Controller Stage 3 Interim Teleop Program)
